UDACITY - Building High Conversion Web Forms - Final Project

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/abendigo/meetme.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/abendigo/meetme)

This is my Meet-Up Event Planner, for the UDACITY Course,
[Building High Conversion Web Forms][1], part of the
[Senior Web Developer Nanodegree program][2]

You can see it in action here: [https://m13d-meetme.firebaseapp.com/][7]

I am using [Polymer][3], and borowing heavily from the [Polymer Start Kit][4]
and [PolymerLabs todo-list][5], as described in
[End to End with Polymer (The Polymer Summit 2015)][6]


To test the unprocessed source files, start a web server (I use polyserve[8] or
  SimpleHTTP2Server[9]) and browse to the app directory.
To test the final packaged code, run 'gulp vulcanize', and serve up the dist directory.
