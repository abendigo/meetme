UDACITY - Building High Conversion Web Forms - Final Project

This is my Meet-Up Event Planner, for the UDACITY Course,
[Building High Conversion Web Forms][1], part of the 
[Senior Web Developer Nanodegree program][2]

You can see it in action here: [https://m13d-meetme.firebaseapp.com/][7]

I am using [Polymer][3], and borowing heavily from the [Polymer Start Kit][4]
and [PolymerLabs todo-list][5], as described in
[End to End with Polymer (The Polymer Summit 2015)][6]
